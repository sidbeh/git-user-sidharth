# webpack-react-starter
A Starter Project using Webpack and ReactJs. This project helps you in getting started with an environment where you just focus on getting your app done. All development and production related settings and configurations are taken care as in-built options.

# What's Included
- Babel Loader
- HTML Loader
- Sass to CSS Transformation
- Minimifcation and Uglification
- Image File Loader
- Font File Loader
- Dev Server with Hot Reloading
- API Proxy Support

# How to use it
- `yarn install`
- `yarn start` to start the app in dev mode.
- `yarn build` to build the app for production.

Note: Even if you are not planning a React Project, you can use this starter just by removing couple of react related dependencies from package.json file and add your own.
